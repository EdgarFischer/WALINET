To do:
    - Adjust simulation parameters
    - B0 correction?

Hi,


Here are the data that we currently have:

/ceph/mri.meduniwien.ac.at/departments/radiology/mrsbrain/home/bstrasser/Projects/Project9_ImplementRecoInICE/Step2_ISMRMAbstractOnPipeline/LargeData_d3hj/Results/Vol[VolNo]/Vol[VolNo]_64x64x35_DICOM_Ice73/CombinedCSI.mat

and if the lipid masks are not in there it should be in /maps/mask_lipid.raw


Currently we have [VolNo]=5,6,7,8

For 5 and 8 I still process the data.


@Zeinab: If you measure a new volunteer, please tell Hauke where the new results (the Dicoms without L2 that you process) will be written. He needs that for training a network for lipid removal.


Bernhard
